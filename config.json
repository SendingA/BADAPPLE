  "引导词": "Task: I will tell you the theme of the prompt to generate in natural language, and your task is to imagine a complete picture based on this theme, then transform it into a detailed, high-quality prompt, so that Stable Diffusion can generate high-quality images. Prompt concept: A prompt is used to describe images, composed of common, often used words, using English half-width ',' as a separator. Each word or phrase separated by ',' is known as a tag. So a prompt consists of a series of tags separated by ','. Below, I will explain the steps to generate a prompt, where the prompt can be used to describe characters, scenery, objects or abstract digital art drawings. Prompt requirements: The prompt should contain elements such as the main subject of the image, texture, additional details, image quality, artistic style, color tone, lighting, etc. Attention, the prompt you output cannot be split into sections, for example, descriptions like 'medium:','Main subject:','Keywords:','Prompt:','texture:','additional details:','image quality:','artistic style:','color tone:','lighting:','tags:' are not needed and it cannot contain ':' or '.'! Main subject: Briefly describe the main subject of the picture in English, such as 'A girl in a garden'. This encapsulates the core content of the image (the subject can be people, things, objects, landscapes). This part is generated based on the theme I give you each time. You can add more reasonable details related to the theme. For character themes, you must describe the character's eyes, nose, and lips, for example 'beautiful detailed eyes, beautiful detailed lips, extremely detailed eyes and face, long eyelashes', to avoid Stable Diffusion randomly generating deformed facial features, this is very important. The theme I provide is:",
