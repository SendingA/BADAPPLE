在遥远的一个国度里，住着一个国王和王后，他们渴望有一个孩子。于是很诚意的向上苍祈祷。“上帝啊！我们都是好国王好王后，请您赐给我们一个孩子吧！”,"In a distant kingdom, there lived a king and queen who longed for a child. With sincere hearts, they prayed to the heavens, ""Dear God, we have been good rulers. Please grant us the blessing of a child!""",,
不久以后，王后果然生下了一个可爱的小公主，这个女孩的皮肤白得像雪一般，双颊红得有如苹果，头发乌黑柔顺，因此，国王和王后就把她取名为“白雪公主”。全国的人民都为白雪公主深深祝福。,"Shortly thereafter, the queen indeed gave birth to a lovely little princess. The child's skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as red as apples, and her hair was black and silky. Consequently, the king and queen named her ""Snow White."" The entire nation offered their heartfelt blessings to Snow White.",,
白雪公主在国王和王后的宠爱之下，逐渐长大了，终于成了一个人见人爱的美少女。白雪公主非常善良、有爱心、她经常和动物一起玩耍。森林的动物，像小鹿、小兔子、松鼠、小鸟都喜欢白雪公主，因为白雪公主会给它们吃食物，还会讲故事给它们听。个性善良犹如天使般的白雪公主，过着幸福快乐的生活。,"Under the doting care of the king and queen, Snow White gradually grew up, blossoming into a beautiful young woman who was adored by everyone she met. Known for her kindness and compassion, she often spent her time playing with animals in the forest. Creatures such as deer, rabbits, squirrels, and birds were all fond of her, as she would not only provide them with food but also entertain them with stories. With a heart as pure as an angel’s, Snow White led a life filled with happiness and joy.",,
可是，好景不长，白雪公主的母亲生病去世了。国王为了白雪公主就迎娶了一位新王后，可是，这位新王后却是个精通法术的女巫。她虽然很美丽，但是个性很骄傲、暴躁。尤其她最恨别人比她美丽。“这是你新母后！”当国王向白雪公主介绍新王后时，她还正为死去的母后感到悲伤呢。,"However, the good times did not last long, as Snow White's mother fell ill and passed away. In order to provide a mother figure for Snow White, the king married a new queen. This new queen, though strikingly beautiful, was a sorceress skilled in dark magic. She possessed a proud and volatile temperament, and above all, she could not bear the thought of anyone surpassing her in beauty. ""This is your new stepmother,"" the king introduced to Snow White, who was still grieving the loss of her beloved mother.",,
新王后有一面很奇特的镜子，从镜子里可以得到一切你想知道的答案。所以，王后经常对着镜子问：“魔镜、魔镜，谁是世界上最美丽的女人？”“全世界最美的女人就是你，王后。”可是，有一天，当王后再问魔镜同样的问题时，魔镜却回答说：“现在白雪公主比你美丽。”,"The new queen possessed a remarkably peculiar mirror, which had the extraordinary ability to provide answers to any question one might ask. Consequently, the queen often stood before it, inquiring, ""Magic mirror, magic mirror, who is the most beautiful woman in the world?"" To which the mirror would invariably respond, ""You, my queen, are the fairest of them all."" However, one fateful day, when the queen posed the same question to the mirror, it replied, ""Now, Snow White surpasses you in beauty.""",,
新王后听了非常生气。“可恶，怎么白雪公主和七个小矮人可以有人比我更美丽，我一定要把她除去。”于是，她就命令宫廷的武士说：“我不想再看到白雪公主了，你找个借口，把她带到森林里偷偷杀掉。杀了以后，把她的心和舌头带回来，做为你杀死她的证据。听到没有？不可以有差错……”“是的，王后……”武士听了这话之后，就真的把白雪公主带到森林里去了。,"The new queen was furious upon hearing the news. ""How despicable! How can Snow White and the seven dwarves be more beautiful than me? I must eliminate her,"" she thought. Determined, she summoned a royal guard and commanded, ""I no longer wish to see Snow White. Find an excuse to take her into the forest and secretly kill her. Afterward, bring back her heart and tongue as proof of her death. Do you understand? There must be no mistakes..."" ""Yes, Your Majesty,"" the guard replied. Following the queen's orders, the guard led Snow White deep into the forest.",,
当武士抽出刀来杀公主的时候，他看到正在采花的公主，纯洁，善良，犹如天使一般，武士不忍心杀她，就向白雪公主说：“皇后命令我杀掉公主你，可是我实在狠不下心，所以你还是往森林里逃走吧！”说完武士见到一头猪，就跑过去宰了它，并取下心和舌头以作为证据。之后，武士便回皇宫去了。,"As the warrior drew his sword to kill the princess, he beheld her in the act of picking flowers, pure and kind, resembling an angel. Overcome with compassion, he could not bring himself to carry out the deed. Instead, he addressed Snow White, saying, ""The queen has commanded me to kill you, but I cannot harden my heart to do so. Therefore, you must flee into the forest."" Having spoken these words, the warrior spotted a wild boar nearby. He swiftly pursued it, slaughtered the animal, and extracted its heart and tongue to present as evidence of the princess's supposed demise. With this task completed, the warrior returned to the royal palace.",,
听到猫头鹰叫声的白雪公主，越走越觉得森林好可怕。突然，眼前有一栋小木屋，于是便又惊又喜的叫着：“啊，是小木屋！”白雪公主急忙向前敲敲门，可是屋子里没有人来开门。她就自作主张的把门打开。进入小木屋后，里面竟然整齐排列着七张小小的床。,"As Snow White wandered deeper into the forest, the haunting call of an owl only heightened her growing sense of dread. The dense woods seemed to close in around her, each step amplifying her unease. Suddenly, her eyes fell upon a quaint little cottage nestled among the trees. A mix of surprise and relief washed over her, and she exclaimed, ""Ah, a cottage!"" Without hesitation, she hurried to the door and knocked, hoping for a friendly face. However, no one answered. Driven by curiosity and desperation, she decided to push the door open herself. Stepping inside, she was astonished to find seven tiny beds neatly arranged in a row, each one perfectly made and waiting as if for their owners to return.",,
白雪公主在森林里跑了一天，觉得非常疲倦，就在那七张小小的床上躺了下来，不知不觉的睡着了。傍晚，当七个小矮人扛着锄头回来时，发现自己的家有人在，而且是睡在自己的床上，大家都很奇怪的问：“这个漂亮的女孩子是谁啊？”“她睡得好香哪！”“这个小姑娘长得真美丽。”小矮人们纷纷议论的声音吵醒了白雪公主。小矮人们很生气的说：“你为什么闯进我们的房子呢？”“各位先生，真是对不起，因为我在森林中迷路了，走了一整天的路，实在是又饿又累，看见这栋小屋，我就走进来休息了。”白雪公主又把事情的经过，一五一十地告诉小矮人。小矮人们听了非常同情白雪公主的遭遇，就把她留下来。“你就在这里住下来吧！”,"Snow White had been running through the forest all day and felt utterly exhausted. She lay down on the seven small beds and, without realizing it, fell asleep. In the evening, when the seven dwarfs returned home carrying their hoes, they discovered someone in their house, sleeping in their beds. They were all very curious and began to ask, ""Who is this beautiful girl? She’s sleeping so soundly! This young girl is truly lovely."" The murmurs of the dwarfs woke Snow White. The dwarfs, feeling angry, demanded, ""Why have you broken into our house?"" Snow White replied, ""Gentlemen, I am truly sorry. I got lost in the forest and walked all day. I was so hungry and tired that when I saw this little cottage, I came in to rest."" She then recounted the entire story to the dwarfs. Hearing her tale, the dwarfs felt deep sympathy for her plight and decided to let her stay. ""You can live here with us!"" they said.",,
白雪公主听到小矮人愿意留下她，很高兴的说：“真是太感谢了，我愿意在这里为你们做饭、铺床、洗衣服、打扫，我什么都愿意为你们做。”“欢迎你，从此这里就是你的家了。”白雪公主每天都把这个小木屋打扫得非常清洁。七个小矮人从森林里回来后，就有可口的晚餐等着他们。就这样日复一日，白雪公主和小矮人过着快乐的生活。,"Upon hearing the dwarves' willingness to let her stay, Snow White expressed her joy and gratitude, saying, ""Thank you so much! I am willing to cook, make the beds, do the laundry, and clean for you—I’ll do anything for you."" The dwarves warmly welcomed her, declaring, ""From now on, this will be your home."" Every day, Snow White diligently kept the little wooden cottage spotless. When the seven dwarves returned from the forest, a delicious dinner awaited them. Day after day, Snow White and the dwarves lived together in happiness and harmony.",,
新王后以为白雪公主已经死了，有一天她又问魔镜说：“魔镜、魔镜，谁是世界上最美丽的人呢？”魔镜回答王后说：“王后，你很美丽，可是白雪公主比你更美丽，她现在在森林中和七个小矮人过着快乐幸福的生活。”王后听了这个回答之后，才知道白雪公主并没有死，她感到很愤怒。“真是可恶极了，一定要让白雪公主从世界上消失”,"The new queen, believing Snow White to be dead, one day asked her magic mirror once more, ""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"" The mirror replied to the queen, ""You are beautiful, my queen, but Snow White is more beautiful still. She now lives happily in the forest with the seven dwarfs."" Upon hearing this, the queen realized that Snow White had not perished, and she was consumed with rage. ""This is utterly intolerable,"" she thought. ""Snow White must be eradicated from this world.""",,
坏心肠的王后想到了一个办法，她在鲜红的苹果外面，涂上了她调配的毒药，准备去毒死白雪公主。“嘿！嘿！白雪公主只要吃一口这个有毒的苹果，就一定会死去。到那个时候，我就是世界上最美丽的女人了。”然后，王后就打扮成老太婆的模样，提着一篮苹果到森林里去了。,"The wicked queen devised a sinister plan. She coated a bright red apple with a poison she had concocted, intending to use it to kill Snow White. ""Heh! Heh! If Snow White takes just one bite of this poisoned apple, she will surely die. And then, I will be the most beautiful woman in the world,"" she thought to herself. Disguising herself as an old woman, the queen then set off into the forest, carrying a basket of apples.",,
坏王后提着一篮苹果来到了小矮人的小木屋前。“可爱的小姑娘，你要不要买一个又红又香的苹果呀！我送一个给你吃吧，相信你一定会喜欢的。”本来就很喜欢吃苹果的白雪公主，看到又红又大的苹果，便高兴地说：“哇！这红红的苹果多么的可爱呀！一定很好吃的。”于是白雪公主就伸手接过那个苹果。结果，白雪公主才咬了一口，就马上倒在地上，昏死过去了。坏心的王后看到她倒在地上，大笑着说：“哈！哈！白雪公主从此以后就从这个世界上消失了。”,"The wicked queen arrived at the dwarfs' cottage, carrying a basket of apples. She addressed the lovely young girl, ""Sweet child, would you like to buy a red and fragrant apple? I'll give you one to eat, and I'm sure you'll love it."" Snow White, who had always been fond of apples, was delighted at the sight of the large, red fruit. She exclaimed, ""Wow! This red apple looks so adorable! It must be delicious."" With that, Snow White reached out and took the apple from the queen. However, as soon as she took a bite, she immediately collapsed to the ground, unconscious. The malevolent queen, seeing her fall, laughed heartily and said, ""Ha! Ha! From now on, Snow White will vanish from this world.""",,
小矮人傍晚回家的时候，看到白雪公主躺在地上像死了一样，他们马上把她抬到床上，尽力的施救，可是白雪公主仍然没有醒过来。小矮人们哭哭啼啼的把白雪公主，放在一个装满鲜花的玻璃棺材内，准备举行盛大的葬礼。,"As the dwarfs returned home in the evening, they discovered Snow White lying on the ground, seemingly lifeless. Immediately, they lifted her onto a bed and exerted all their efforts to revive her, yet she remained unconscious. Overwhelmed with sorrow, the dwarfs tenderly placed Snow White into a glass coffin adorned with fresh flowers, preparing to hold a grand funeral in her honor.",,
这时，邻国的王子正好路过森林，看到了玻璃棺材里美丽可爱的公主，还有在旁哀悼的小矮人和小动物们。王子知道事情的经过之后，含着泪水悲伤地注视白雪公主说：“可怜的公主，如果你能复活的话，该有多好呀！”王子向白雪公主献上了花束，含情脉脉地凝视着她说：“她的皮肤雪白，脸颊红润，好像睡着一般，根本不像死去的人。”最后，王子情不自禁地俯身吻了她。,"At that moment, the prince from a neighboring kingdom happened to pass through the forest and noticed the beautiful and lovely princess lying in the glass coffin, surrounded by mourning dwarfs and small animals. Upon learning the tragic story, the prince gazed at Snow White with tears in his eyes and sorrowfully remarked, ""Poor princess, how wonderful it would be if you could come back to life!"" He then presented her with a bouquet of flowers, looking at her affectionately and saying, ""Her skin is as white as snow, her cheeks are rosy, and she appears as if she is merely asleep, not at all like someone who has passed away."" Finally, unable to resist, the prince leaned down and kissed her.",,
突然，白雪公主从口中吐出了吃进去的苹果。原来是王子对公主的爱，使毒苹果失去了效力，公主也逐渐恢复了体温，睁开明亮的双眼。白雪公主苏醒了过来，好像是从长睡中醒来一般，她的脸颊和唇依旧是那么的红润。“哇！你们看到了吧！白雪公主活过来了！白雪公主复活了！”小矮人们都雀跃不已，兴奋地叫着。王子更是满心欢喜地说：“真是太好了！白雪公主重生了，上帝真的不会让我失望啊！”连在旁的动物们也吱吱喳喳谈论不休。,"Suddenly, Snow White coughed up the apple she had bitten into. It turned out that the prince's love for her had neutralized the poison in the apple, allowing her temperature to gradually return to normal. Her bright eyes fluttered open, and she awoke as if from a long slumber, her cheeks and lips still as rosy as ever. ""Wow! Did you see that? Snow White is alive! She’s come back to life!"" The dwarfs leaped with joy, shouting in excitement. The prince, overwhelmed with happiness, exclaimed, ""This is truly wonderful! Snow White has been reborn, and God has not let me down!"" Even the animals nearby chattered endlessly, sharing in the joyous moment.",,
王子向白雪公主说明了他的来历之后，就握着公主的双手，温柔地说：“公主，你愿意和我一起回皇宫，做我的王妃吗？”白雪公主羞怯地点头答应了。,"The prince, after explaining his background to Snow White, gently took her hands in his and spoke with tenderness. He asked her if she would be willing to return with him to the palace and become his princess. With a shy and modest demeanor, Snow White nodded in agreement, accepting his heartfelt proposal.",,
小矮人和森林的动物们，有的手舞足蹈，有的欢声歌唱，为王子和白雪公主歌颂庆贺。“祝愿王子和公主，永远幸福快乐！”王子带着白雪公主，骑着白马向小矮人和森林里的动物们告别，他们一直回头向小矮人们挥手说再见：“小矮人们，感谢你们对我的照顾，我会永远记得你们的。”“祝你们幸福，再见！”,"The dwarfs and the forest animals were filled with joy, some dancing with abandon, others singing merrily, all celebrating and praising the prince and Snow White. ""May the prince and princess be forever happy and joyful!"" they cheered. The prince, with Snow White by his side, rode off on his white horse, bidding farewell to the dwarfs and the forest creatures. They kept turning back, waving goodbye to the dwarfs, saying, ""Dear dwarfs, thank you for all your care. I will always remember you."" ""Wishing you happiness, farewell!""",,
坏心的王后自从毒害了白雪公主之后，就以为白雪公主必死无疑，所以非常高兴。有一天，她满怀自信地问魔镜：“魔镜、魔镜，现在世界上最美丽的人应该是我了吧！”魔镜回答说：“除了白雪公主以外，你是最美丽的人，但是，在邻国生活的白雪公主比你漂亮千万倍。”王后听了觉得很奇怪，她想白雪公主不是被她害死了吗？可是又想到白雪公主运气一向很好，“简直是气死人了，我就不相信不能杀掉白雪公主！”王后原本就是个女巫，于是她骑着魔扫帚，带着魔剑，飞往邻国，准备去除掉她的眼中钉。当她飞到邻国的上空时，突然一道闪电朝坏王后打来。“劈！叭！”一阵响声把女巫王后从扫帚上打下来。女巫王后终于受到上帝的处罚，结束了作恶多端的生命。,"The wicked queen, after poisoning Snow White, was convinced that the princess was surely dead and thus felt immense joy. One day, filled with confidence, she asked her magic mirror, ""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all now?"" The mirror replied, ""You are the fairest here, but Snow White, who lives in the neighboring kingdom, is a thousand times more beautiful than you."" The queen was puzzled, thinking she had already killed Snow White. Yet, recalling Snow White's usual good fortune, she fumed, ""This is infuriating! I refuse to believe I can't kill Snow White!"" Being a witch herself, the queen mounted her enchanted broomstick, armed with a magical sword, and flew to the neighboring kingdom to eliminate her nemesis. As she soared over the kingdom, a sudden bolt of lightning struck the evil queen. ""Crack! Bang!"" The loud noise knocked the witch queen off her broomstick. Finally, the witch queen faced divine retribution, bringing an end to her life of malevolence.",,
此时，王子的国家却举国欢腾，因为美丽的白雪公主答应了王子的求婚，正在举行盛大的婚礼。小矮人和森林的动物们也被邀请来参加婚礼，在全国人民的祝福声中，王子和白雪公主将永远快乐的生活在一起。,"At this moment, the prince's kingdom was filled with jubilation, as the beautiful Snow White had accepted his proposal, and a grand wedding ceremony was underway. The dwarfs and the forest animals were also invited to partake in the celebration. Amidst the blessings of the entire nation, the prince and Snow White were destined to live together in eternal happiness.",,
